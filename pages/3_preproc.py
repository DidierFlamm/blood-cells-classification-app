How it works (in simple terms):  
‚Ä¢ Each pixel in the image has an intensity value between 0 and 1 for each RGB channel..  
‚Ä¢ You choose a threshold value (e.g., 0.5).  
‚Ä¢ If the pixel value is higher than the threshold, it is set to white (1).  
‚Ä¢ If the pixel value is lower, it is set to black (0).  
This transforms the image into a binary (black and white) format, reducing file size and making object detection easier, thus shortening the model training time.
